# Classical Computers
Classical computers can't generate true random numbers because they rely on deterministic algorithms and processes. These algorithms use initial values, called seeds, to generate a sequence of numbers that appears random. However, the sequence is deterministic, meaning that if you know the seed and the algorithm, you can predict the entire sequence.

# Quantum Computers
In contrast, quantum computers can generate true random numbers due to the inherent probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics. When a qubit in superposition is measured, the outcome is genuinely random, and there's no way to predict it with certainty. This allows quantum computers to generate truly random numbers, unlike classical computers.
